## 🔎 Executive Summary:
**Transformed 2.5M+ raw transaction records** into actionable insights for a snack food manufacturer, identyfing **high-value customer segments** and **pricing opportunities** through Python powered analysis. 

## 💻 Skills Demonstrated: 

### 🔧 Techincal Skills:
-> Data Wrangling: 
**Pandas** | **Automated Cleaning Pipelines** 
( Handled missing data, outliers and European decimal formats). 

-> Advanced Visualtion: 
**Seaborn** | **Matplotlib** | Data Storytelling 
( Created 4 publication quality charts)

-> Version Control: 
**Git** | **Github** | Project Documentation

### 📈 Business Skills:
-> Customer Segmentation
-> Premium vs Budget + Mainstream pricing analysis 
-> Data driven reccomendation development 

## 🏆 What this demonstrates: 
✅ **Real World Problem Solving**: Transalted messy retail data into clear business intelligence. 
✅ **Technical Agility**: Use of Mutiple Python Libraries in a production enviornment. 
✅ **Communication Skills**: Executive summary and detailed notes and processing.

## 💡 Insight ( To be added to ): 
1. **Budget Older Singles and Couples are the most important customer group** accounting for the highest purchase of chips despite relatively smaller population size compared to 2nd and 3rd highest categories.

## 📝 Improvements ( To be Implemented ): 
1. Conversion to only vectorised operations in custom data cleaning for speed and optimisation.
2. Overall code syntax and structure simplification.
3. Statistical tests ( t - test) to check whether results obtained are statistically sound.
4. Formulation of finalised report detailing reccomendations and with stunning clear visuals.
